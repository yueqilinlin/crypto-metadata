The user evaluation - token incentive model rewards contributors (including community builders, content providers and communicators) who create value content for the platform, and provides MTS rewards for these contributors. The goal is to link people and blockchain related content together, and to ensure that the content is valuable to the users. The voting also allows information to bring monetary worth back to quality content."
