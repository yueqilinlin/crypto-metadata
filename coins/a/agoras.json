        "en": "Agoras is an application over Tau-Chain, being first and foremost a smart currency offering predictable and verifiable contracts, and will offer several markets.\r\n\r\nAGORAS CODE-FOR-MONEY MARKET\r\nEliminating the trust problem between programmers and entities who hire them. Can publish a smart contract that whoever supplies a code with a proof that it meets given requirements, wins coins automatically. Thanks to Tau language, such proofs can be trusted.\r\n\r\nCOMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES MARKET\r\nEveryone will be able to rent out their computational resources (CPU, GPU, Disk) and get paid for it. Lack of many computers is a major bottleneck in many fields (especially medicine design) and cloud/supercomputing companies cannot compete with the higher quantity and lower cost that home computers can offer.\r\n\r\nDECENTRALIZED SMART SEARCH ENGINE\r\nWith large enough network, Tau can crawl the web overnight. We will have a self-incentivizing search engine such that the data is shared by everyone and supporting nodes get paid.\r\n\r\nAgoras will allow smart contracts, that you can know their consequences beforehand. That thanks to the decidability of Tau-Chain.s language. Will also support true peer-to-peer contracts: business that need a private arena, can take place between two Agoras clients.\r\n\r\nAgoras smart currency is on presale now. There is a total amount of 42,000,000 intermediate coins (IDNI Agoras Tokens), that represent 100% of future Agoras coins.\r\nStarting from 01/05/2016 the price of one IDNI Agoras Tokens will be 20 cents (USD), going up 5% monthly.\r\n'Premine' for long-term development and 3rd party partners is 3%.\r\nAll unsold coins up to Agoras. genesis will be destroyed. For example, if you hold 1% out of 42M coins, and only 21M are sold, then with the actual Agoras coins you will hold a fraction of 2% out of all coins."
