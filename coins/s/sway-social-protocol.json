        "en": "Every piece of content you create can be a piece of art. Clout.art turns your most valuable content, such as your most successful Instagram posts, into unique NFTs.\r\n\r\nClout means influence and power. It describes how a creator can affect the actions or beliefs of others. Clout can also be measured in likes, comments, and shares, collectively known as engagement. If clout can be measured, it can be valued. The NFTs provide a mechanism for new value creation and monetization of social value of existing content.\r\n\r\nClout.art is where creators and fans come together to create, grow or exchange social capital through the SWAY token. Users are able to stake SWAY with their favourite creators inside their creator pools. Every time the creator sells an NFT, the stakers get rewarded."
