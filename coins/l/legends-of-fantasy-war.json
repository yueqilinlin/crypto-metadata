        "en": "Legend of Fantasy War is a unique 3D turn-based role-playing online blockchain game. By blockchainizing in-game items, the game provides players ownership of in-game items by owning so-called Non-Fungible Token (NFT). With an engaging storyline, players can both entertain themselves and collect valuable items, even increase the value of items while playing games solo or with others. Thanks to the blockchain of items, owners of NFTs can sell, exchange, and auction transparently on the Legend of Fantasy War NFT marketplace."
